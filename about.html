      <h1>Meet the Founder</h1>

      <p>
        Bucketlistly was born from the passion of Pete R., a travel blogger,
        filmmaker, and photographer who has spent over six years exploring the
        world. With a camera in one hand and a backpack on the other, Pete has
        journeyed through countless countries, capturing breathtaking landscapes
        and unforgettable moments. His vision for Bucketlistly is to build a
        platform that not only shares his adventures but also provides the
        resources and support for others to embark on their own.
